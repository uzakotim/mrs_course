1) 10 points - reshaping formation function in isolation
reshaping_test - reshaping_evaluate - reshaping_debug.yaml  - reshaping_test
shoud run less than 60 - 80 seconds

2) 15 points - passing following robot - easy simulation 
3) 25 points - passing following robot - difficult simulation - with noise filtering of ranging measurements and robot runs from you

1 method - averaging
2 method - better optimisation - Levenberg Manguard

-----------------
|total 35 points|

following the robot
state machine

Multilateration

- plot circle around drone1
- plot circle around drone2
- plot circle around drone3
- find the intersection point


- in practice - optimisation task
- we find the point the closest to the intersection

---> approximate position of UGV

---> improve the simple approach


--------------------------------
Formation Reshaping

moving with formation closest to the UGV

- not in line

given: positions of drones XYZ
from 2 to 10 drones

: set of final positions
- can create paths in priority order

- sequential planning;
- plan path and put it to the obstacle space

- make sure that drones do not get closer than 1.2 m

- use given a* solver

- find right resolution < 3
- resolution > small value - A* is slow and path is very dense
- take the path and process it to make it shorter
- delete vertex if no collisions by segments

- insert obstacle cell 

--------------------------------
Moving formation is done with virtual leader method
- insure that formation has proper shape to avoid collisions
- already done

--------------------------------
Constraint on formation:
- formation is supposed to be compact
- local formation

-------------------------------
decide what you gonna do, call change formation shape, change root


option 1) scanning the whole square , process, get to the sopt
option 2) systematic scanning, then decide on following method
get close to robot
3) many other methods
 follow the robot for a minute

while drones are in motion, check if drones are in motion with flag

KF const velocity of robot

-------------------------------
comup with your own idea

--------------------------------
collision avoidance

depends on resolution 
iflate obstacles by Minkowski sum


if std::isfinite( double ...) 
    number is safe
